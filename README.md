Hello!

My name is Juan Miguel SÃ¡nchez Arce.

I originally studied translation at the University of Geneva and then became a translator / project manager before discovering my passion: programming.

In August 2020, I started learning coding on my spare time with the goal of developing a little videogame of my own (using Unity and C#). 
After a few months, I realized I loved it so much that I decided that I wanted to do that for a living and I applied to the Constructor Academy program in Zurich in order to become a full-stack developer.

I have been working as a full-stack developer since September 2021 at camptocamp, and have actively taken part in the development of Vuejs frontend applications linked to the Odoo ERP, as well as integrating the ERP itself according to the different customers' needs.
