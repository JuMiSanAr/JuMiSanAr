Hello!

My name is Juan Miguel SÃ¡nchez Arce, and I studied translation at the University of Geneva and then became a translator / project manager before discovering my passion: programming.

In August 2020, I started learning coding on my spare time with the goal of developing a little videogame of my own (using Unity and C#). 
After a few months, I realized I loved it so much that I decided that I wanted to do that for a living and I applied to the Propulsion Academy program in Zurich in order to become a full-stack developer.

Thanks to it, I gained the knowledge necessary to work with:

  - Git
  
  - Javascript
    - React

  - Typescript
  
  - Python
    - Django
    - Django REST
  
  - HTML
  
  - CSS
    - SASS
    - React Styled-Components  
  
  - SQL
  
  - Docker
  
  - CI/CD
  - Testing

I'm now looking for professional opportunities in the sector, as well as experiences that help me contribute to real-world projects (as well as keep loving what I do!)


Amongst the things that I like to do in my free time, I'm an active volleyball player, a classical musician (French Horn) and a videogame enthusiast.
